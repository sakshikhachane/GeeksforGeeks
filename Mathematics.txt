1. To find the count of digits in the number:
   Approach 1: O(n) => Divide number by 10 and increase count
   Approach 2: O(1) => N= log10(n) +1 
        Let K be the number of digits
   	K-1<=log10(N)<K. =>  K-1+1 <=log10(N)+1< K+1  => K<= log10(N)+1 < K+1 

2. Arithmetic Progression:
   General Formulas to solve problems related to Arithmetic Progressions: If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘d’ is the common difference:
	nth term of an AP = a + (n-1)*d.
	Arithmetic Mean = Sum of all terms in the AP / Number of terms in the AP.
	Sum of ‘n’ terms of an AP = (n/2) (first term + last term) = (n/2) [ 2a + (n-1) d ].

3. Geometric Progression:
   If ‘a’ is the first term and ‘r’ is the common ratio:
	nth term of a GP = a*r^n-1.
	Geometric Mean = nth root of product of n terms in the GP.
	Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r < 1) = [a (1 – r^n)] / [1 – r].
	Sum of ‘n’ terms of a GP (r > 1) = [a (r^n – 1)] / [r – 1].
	Sum of infinite terms of a GP (r < 1) = (a) / (1 – r).

   The behaviour of a geometric sequence depends on the value of the common ratio. If the common ratio is:
	Positive, the terms will all be the same sign as the initial term.
	Negative, the terms will alternate between positive and negative.
	Greater than 1, there will be exponential growth towards positive or negative infinity (depending on the sign of the initial term).
	1, the progression is a constant sequence.
	Between -1 and 1 but not zero, there will be exponential decay towards zero.
	-1, the progression is an alternating sequence.
	Less than -1, for the absolute values there is exponential growth towards (unsigned) infinity, due to the alternating sign.

4. Quadratic equation:
    a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0
    Roots: roots = (-b ± √(b2 - 4ac))/2a
    *) If b2 < 4ac, then roots are complex (not real).
    *) If b2 = 4ac, then roots are real and both roots are same.
    *) If b2 > 4ac, then roots are real and different.

5. LCM:
   LCM : LCM stands for Least Common Multiple. The lowest number which is exactly divisible by each of the given numbers is called the least common multiple of those numbers. 
   Union  or highest power of all the prime numbers

6. HCF or GCD:
   The term HCF stands for Highest Common Factor. The largest number that divides two or more numbers is the highest common factor (HCF) for those numbers.
   Intersection or lowest power of all the prime numbers
